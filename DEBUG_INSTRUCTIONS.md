# Debugging Instructions

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5174 (or the port shown in the terminal)

2. Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)

3. Check the Console tab for any errors, especially:
   - "Cannot set properties of undefined" errors
   - Service Worker errors
   - Context-related errors

4. Check the Network tab to verify:
   - All resources load correctly
   - No 404 errors for static assets
   - Service Worker registration (if enabled)

5. Test functionality:
   - Navigation between pages
   - Tool card interactions
   - Favorite functionality
   - Search functionality

## Common Issues to Look For

### Service Worker Issues
- Failed to execute 'addAll' on 'Cache'
- Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'Children')

### Context Issues
- "useFavorites must be used within a FavoritesProvider"
- "useTools must be used within a ToolsProvider"
- "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider"

### Rendering Issues
- Blank pages
- Missing components
- Undefined property access errors

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   ```

2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

3. Check the terminal for build errors

4. Verify all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Additional Testing

1. Test in an incognito/private window
2. Test in different browsers
3. Test on mobile devices
4. Verify all routes work correctly
